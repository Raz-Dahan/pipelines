# Pipelines
Streamlined CI/CD Pipelines using different platforms

### Kubernetes Pipeline
☸️ Elevate your CI/CD game with our Kubernetes pipeline. This is where the magic happens – a holistic approach that integrates Docker, Docker Compose, Helm, Terraform, Prometheus, and Grafana without any downtime and with separate stage for addintional steps to ensure maximum efficiency and reliability.

**What sets our Kubernetes Pipeline apart:**
- 🛠️ **Infrastructure as Code**: Leverage Terraform to define your infrastructure in code and achieve consistency across deployments.
- ⚙️ **Orchestration with Helm**: Harness the power of Helm charts to define, install, and manage even the most complex applications on Kubernetes.
- 📊 **Monitoring Nirvana**: Gain deep insights into your application's performance with Prometheus and visualize the data using Grafana dashboards.
- 🌐 **End-to-End Integration**: Seamlessly combine all the previous pipelines into a unified, end-to-end CI/CD process that maximizes efficiency and reduces errors.

### Docker Compose Pipeline
🚢 Orchestrate complex multi-container applications with ease using our Docker Compose pipeline. Simplify local development and deployment.

### Docker Pipeline
🐳 Build, test, and deploy your applications using our Docker pipeline. Effortlessly containerize your code for consistency across environments.

### Ansible Pipeline
🤖 Automate your deployment with our Ansible pipeline. Say goodbye to manual setups and hello to seamless configurations.
