# Pipelines
Streamlined CI/CD Pipelines using different platforms

### [Kubernetes Pipeline](kubernetes-pipeline)
☸️ Kubernetes pipeline that integrates Docker, Docker Compose, Helm, Terraform, Prometheus, and Grafana without any downtime and with separate stage for addintional steps to ensure maximum efficiency and reliability.

**What sets our Kubernetes Pipeline apart:**
- 🛠️ **Infrastructure as Code**: Leverage Terraform to define your infrastructure in code and achieve consistency across deployments.
- ⚙️ **Orchestration with Helm**: Harness the power of Helm charts to define, install, and manage even the most complex applications on Kubernetes.
- 📊 **Monitoring Nirvana**: Gain deep insights into your application's performance with Prometheus and visualize the data using Grafana dashboards.
- 🌐 **End-to-End Integration**: Seamlessly combine all the previous pipelines into a unified, end-to-end CI/CD process that maximizes efficiency and reduces errors.

### [Docker Compose Pipeline](docker-compose-pipeline)
🚢 Orchestrate complex multi-container applications with Docker Compose pipeline. Simplify development and deployment.

### [Docker Pipeline](docker-pipeline)
🐳 Build, test, and deploy using Docker pipeline. containerize code for consistency across environments.

### [Ansible Pipeline](ansible-pipeline)
🤖 Automate your deployment with Ansible pipeline.


Feel free to explore the pipelines and adapt them to fit your unique needs.
